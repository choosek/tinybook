    """
    Data structure for maintaining the information associated with a node
    and performing node operations.

    Suppose that a workflow is supported by three parties. The :obj:`node`
    objects would be instantiated locally by each of these three parties.

    >>> nodes = [node(), node(), node()]

    The preprocessing workflow that the nodes must execute can be simulated
    using the :obj:`preprocess` function. It is assumed that all permitted
    prices are integers greater than or equal to ``0`` and strictly less
    than a fixed maximum value. The number of distinct prices must be supplied
    to the :obj:`preprocess` function.

    >>> preprocess(nodes, prices=16)

    A request must be submitted for the opportunity to submit an order. The
    clients can create :obj:`request` instances for this purpose. Below, two
    clients each create their request.

    >>> request_ask = request.ask()
    >>> request_bid = request.bid()

    Each client can deliver their request to each node, and each node can then
    locally use its :obj:`masks` method to generate masks that can be returned
    to the requesting client.

    >>> masks_ask = [node.masks(request_ask) for node in nodes]
    >>> masks_bid = [node.masks(request_bid) for node in nodes]

    Each client can then generate locally an :obj:`order` instance (*i.e.*, a
    masked representation of the order).

    >>> order_ask = order(masks_ask, 4)
    >>> order_bid = order(masks_bid, 9)

    Each client can broadcast its masked order to all the nodes. Each node can
    locally assemble these as they arrive. Once a node has received both masked
    orders, it can determine its shares of the overall outcome using the
    :obj:`outcome` method.

    >>> shares = [node.outcome(order_ask, order_bid) for node in nodes]

    The overall outcome can be reconstructed from the shares by the workflow
    operator using the :obj:`reveal` function. The outcome is either ``None``
    (if the bid price does not equal or exceed the ask price) or a :obj:`range`
    instance representing the bid-ask spread (where for a :obj:`range` instance
    ``r``, the ask price is ``min(r)`` and the bid price is ``max(r)``).

    >>> reveal(shares)
    range(4, 10)
    >>> min(reveal(shares))
    4
    >>> max(reveal(shares))
    9

    In the example below, the bid price does not exceed the price of the ask.

    >>> order_ask = order(masks_ask, 11)
    >>> order_bid = order(masks_bid, 7)
    >>> shares = [node.outcome(order_ask, order_bid) for node in nodes]
    >>> reveal(shares) is None
